    display by looking at the id or at what's written between the <h2> tags.

  These scripts are written in JavaScript. You'll be breaking them down as part of
  a quiz. Essentially, the next few lines are checking to see if you have not
  changed each section of the resume. If you have not made any changes to a section
  of the resume, then that part of the resume does not show up. More on this in the
  course.
